# covid19_data_analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to infection rates, recovery, and healthcare responses using Python and Power BI.

## Objectives
- Compare COVID-19 cases across countries.
- Analyze correlation between key COVID-19 metrics.
- Detect trends and anomalies in pandemic data.
- Use PCA and clustering to classify countries based on response and impact.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data cleaning, EDA, PCA, clustering.
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and reports.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## Responsibilities
- Extracted datasets from WHO and cleaned them.
- Handled missing values using averaging.
- Performed EDA and correlation analysis.
- Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Clustered countries using unsupervised learning.
- Built Power BI dashboards for visualization.

## Insights
- Highlighted countries with similar infection and response profiles.
- Identified periods of significant case surges and healthcare strain.
- Created dashboards for better monitoring and decision-making.
